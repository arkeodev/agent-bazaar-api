    "**Docker** is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. **Docker Swarm** is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers that turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual host. By combining FastAPI with Docker and Docker Swarm, you can build scalable, distributed, and highly available API services.\n",
